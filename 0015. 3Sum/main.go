/*
该题最简单的做法就是遍历，遍历所有的可能性，手动的去重。
为了简化解题方式，首先对切片进行排序，这样我们就可以利用两个
下标，从头到尾的遍历数组。
主要逻辑（已排好序）：

a[begin] + a[end] == -a[index]

index 从0 开始遍历数组，然后用两个指针分别从index + 1和lenth - 1开始
查找满足下列公式的组合。

a[begin] + a[end] == -a[index]

需要注意的是如果前后两个数据是一样的就不需要再求了，因为他们的组合也是一样的。

e.g:

-1 -1 -2 0 0 1 2

-1 0 1会重复多次，所以中间加了去重。


a[begin] + a[end] > a[i]:
	end--
a[begin] + a[end] < a[i]:
	begin++
a[begin] + a[end] = a[i]:
	end++ begin++
加上限制条件，防止越界
